## Background

In [GSP-87: Feature Gates](./87-feature-gates.md), we have the concept of `features` to resolve inconsistent behavior. And then in [GSP-109: Redesign Features](./109-redesign-features.md), we have a huge redesign about it. We have the following features for now:

- LoosePair
- VirtualDir
- VirtualLink
- VirtualObjectMetadata

It's obvious that they are only a subset of all features we support.

In fact, we can categorize all features into three kinds:

- Native support
- No native support but could be virtual
- Can't support

In the past, we only care about features that "No native support but could be virtual". Because other features can be handled easily: if we support, everything will work fine; If not, we just don't implement the interface.

However, [GSP-751: Write Empty File Behavior](./751-write-empty-file-behavior.md) rise a new question: How to handle the different behavior of the same interface?

Moreover, we do have different capabilities and limitations in storage services, for application or user, the capabilities to access the service is not accurately available by way of interface type assertion.

Maybe it's time for us to drop the idea that we introduced in [GSP-1: Unify storager behavior](./1-unify-storager-behavior.md).

## Proposal

I propose to support feature flag for operational rampups, and also provide public API for users or applications to acquire service capabilities.

### Features Category

For now, we will classify features as follows, other categories of features should be introduced by new GSPs.

- Operation features: All operations.
- Operation-related features: Operation-related specific behavior. Currently, we have the following operation-related features:
  - WriteEmptyObject
- Virtual features: No native support but could be virtual. Currently, we have the following virtual features:
  - LoosePair
  - VirtualDir
  - VirtualLink
  - VirtualObjectMetadata

### Features Reimplementation

#### Add operations back to Storager

- Add all operations in interfaces for storage service like `Copy`, `Move`, etc back to `Storager`.
- Support `Features()` which returns the supported features in `Storager` interfaces. So is `Servicer` interface.

```go
type Storager interface {
	Features() StorageFeatures
	
	String() string
	// Storage
	Create(path string, pairs ...Pair) (o *Object)
	Delete(path string, pairs ...Pair) (err error)
	DeleteWithContext(ctx context.Context, path string, pairs ...Pair) (err error)
	...
	
	// Copy
	Copy(src string, dst string, pairs ...Pair) (err error)
	CopyWithContext(ctx context.Context, src string, dst string, pairs ...Pair) (err error)
	
	...
	
	mustEmbedUnimplementedStorager()
}

// UnimplementedStorager must be embedded to have forward compatible implementations.
type UnimplementedStorager struct {
}

func (s UnimplementedStorager) mustEmbedUnimplementedStorager() {

}
func (s UnimplementedStorager) String() string {
	return "UnimplementedStorager"
}
func (s UnimplementedStorager) Create(path string, pairs ...Pair) (o *Object) {
	return
}
func (s UnimplementedStorager) Delete(path string, pairs ...Pair) (err error) {
	err = NewOperationNotImplementedError("delete")
	return
}

...
```

#### Feature Flags API

`ServiceFeatures` and `StorageFeatures` structs will be generated on go-storage side to represent the features supported by the storage container and storage service, respectively. The full feature list include operation features, operation-related features and virtual features.
- Operation-related features will be defined in `features.toml`. We will introduce a new `virtual` property for virtual features to distinguish them from operation-related features.

Take `StorageFeatures` as an example:

```go
// StorageFeatures indicates features supported by storage.
type StorageFeatures struct {
	// operation features
	CreateAppend                   bool
	WriteAppend                    bool
	CommitAppend                   bool
	CreateBlock                    bool
	WriteBlock                     bool
	CombineBlock                   bool
	ListBlock                      bool
	CreateDir                      bool
	Fetch                          bool
	CreateLink                     bool
	Move                           bool
	CreateMultipart                bool
	WriteMultipart                 bool
	CompleteMultipart              bool
	ListMultipart                  bool
	CreatePage                     bool
	WritePage                      bool
	Create                         bool
	Delete                         bool
	Metadata                       bool
	List                           bool
	Read                           bool
	Stat                           bool
	Write                          bool
	QuerySignHTTPDelete            bool
	QuerySignHTTPRead              bool
	QuerySignHTTPWrite             bool
	QuerySignHTTPCreateMultipart   bool
	QuerySignHTTPCompleteMultipart bool
	QuerySignHTTPWriteMultipart    bool
	QuerySignHTTPlistMultipart     bool
	
	// operation-related features
	WriteEmptyObject bool
	
	// virtual features
	LoosePair             bool
	VirtualDir            bool
	VirtualLink           bool
	VirtualObjectMetadata bool
}
```

For service side:

- Services need to declare all the features they support.
  - Stub implementations for all non-supported operations will be generated.
  - The implementation of `Features()` will be generated according to the declared supported features.
- go-storage will generate the struct and functions for virtual features on service side.
  - Rename the generated `ServiceFeatures`/`StorageFeatures` pairs and structs to `ServiceVirtualFeatures`/`StorageVirtualFeatures`, as will the `WithStorageFeatures()`/`WithServiceFeatures()` functions.
  - Reserve the generated virtual feature pairs `enable_xxx` and `EnableXxx()` functions for virtual features.

For user side: Users should not access storage features directly:

- Enable virtual features when init the storage.
- Check the feature support flag via public API.

```go
store, err := services.NewStoragerFromString("<service>://<name><work_dir>?enable_virtual_dir")
if err != nil {
	return err
}

if store.Features().Copy {
	err := store.Copy(oldpath, newpath)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
}

if store.Features().Write && store.Features().WriteEmptyObject {
	err := store.Write(path, nil, size)
    if err != nil {
    	return err
    }
}
```

## Rationale

### Feature Flag

Feature flags (also known as feature toggles or feature flipping) is a technique in development that allows you to enable or disable a feature without deploying any codes. The idea behind feature flags is to build conditional feature branches into code in order to make logic available only to certain groups of users at a time. If the flag is `on`, new code is executed, if the flag is `off`, the code is skipped.

Feature flag can be used in the following scenarios:

- Adding a new feature to an application.
- Enhancing an existing feature in an application.
- Hiding or disabling a feature.
- Extending an interface.

Feature flags solutions:

- [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) is a feature management lets you turn new features on/off in production with no need for redeployment.
- [go-feature-flag](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag) is a simple and complete feature flag solution, without any complex backend system to install.
- [Etsy's Feature flagging API](https://github.com/etsy/feature) used for operational rampups and A/B testing.

## Compatibility

- Interface type assertion for storage capability will be deprecated: the following interfaces will be deprecated, and the related operations will be added back to `Storager` interface. Caller need to check supported features before use them.
  - Appender
  - Blocker
  - Copier
  - Direr
  - Mover
  - Multiparter
  - Pager
  - StorageHTTPSigner
  - MultipartHTTPSigner
- All API call that use `ServiceFeatures` and `StorageFeatures` could be affected. We could migrate as follows:
  - Mark `ServiceFeatures` and `StorageFeatures` related as deprecated.
  - Release a new version for go-storage and all services bump to this version with all references to `ServiceFeatures`, `StorageFeatures` etc updated.
  - Remove deprecated structs in the next major version.

## Implementation

- For go-storage
  - Rename the current generated `ServiceFeatures` and `StorageFeatures` pairs and structs for services, and re-generate them on go-storage side.
  - Remove interfaces other than `Servicer` and `Storager`, and add the related operations back to `Storager`.
  - Add `write_empty_object` in `features.toml` and add `virtual` property for virtual features.
  - Generate codes for services.
- For storage services
  - Remove `implement` fields in `service.toml`.
  - Declare all supported features in `features` field in `service.toml`.
- For integration test
  - Integration test should not use type assertions, but run the test cases according to features.
