# onedrive

Microsoft [OneDrive] (formerly SkyDrive) is a file hosting service and synchronization service operated 
by Microsoft as part of its web version of Office.
This project will use [OneDrive]'s native SDK to implement [go-storage]'s Storager interface,
enabling users to manipulate data in [OneDrive] through a unified interface.
